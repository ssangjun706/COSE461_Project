    "chosen": "## Step 1: Identify the most relevant fields for prediction accuracy\nTo predict the 'Survived' column, we should focus on fields that are known to have a significant impact on survival rates in the context of the Titanic disaster. These include 'Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Fare', and 'Embarked'. The 'PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', and 'Cabin' are less directly relevant to survival prediction.\n\n## Step 2: Contextualize the input data into a natural language prompt\nGiven the passenger's details, we can create a prompt that sets a scene or provides context that could help the language model understand the factors influencing survival. For instance, mentioning the class of travel ('Pclass') can imply the level of luxury and potentially the location on the ship, which could affect survival chances. The sex and age of the passenger are also crucial, as historical data shows differences in survival rates among these groups.\n\n## Step 3: Incorporate domain knowledge and semantic relationships\nThe Titanic's sinking is a well-documented historical event, and certain factors are known to have influenced survival rates. For example, women and children were prioritized for lifeboats, and passengers in higher classes had better access to these limited resources. The passenger's embarkation point ('Embarked') and the fare paid could also provide insights into their socioeconomic status and potentially their survival chances.\n\n## Step 4: Construct the prompt with diverse sentence structures and terminology\nTo create a sophisticated and natural-sounding prompt, we should vary the sentence structure and use appropriate domain terminology. This could involve describing the passenger's situation, referencing the known challenges of the Titanic's sinking, and directly asking for a prediction based on the provided information.\n\n## Step 5: Finalize the prompt with the required response instructions\nThe prompt must conclude with specific instructions for the language model, directing it to respond with either 'DEAD' or 'ALIVE' without any additional explanations or text.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{A first-class passenger, Mr. John Farthing, boarded the Titanic at Southampton, traveling alone with no siblings or spouses and no parents or children accompanying him.

The inclusion of details such as travel class, age, sex, embarkation point, and family status provides a comprehensive understanding of the passenger's circumstances, which can influence the prediction accuracy.\n\nKey aspects of the prompt generation process include:\n\n1.  **Selection of Relevant Fields**: The prompt incorporates the most relevant fields from the input data, including `Pclass`, `Age`, `Sex`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Embarked`, and `Fare`. These fields offer valuable insights into the passenger's socioeconomic status, travel arrangements, and potential vulnerabilities during the voyage.\n2.  **Contextualization and Rephrasing**: The prompt rephrases and contextualizes the input data values to create a natural and engaging narrative. This approach helps the language model understand the relationships between different fields and their implications for the survival outcome.\n3.  **Common Knowledge and Domain Terminology**: The prompt leverages common knowledge about the Titanic's social dynamics, travel classes, and embarkation points to create a coherent and meaningful context. The use of domain-specific terminology, such as \"third class\" and \"Southampton,\" adds to the prompt's authenticity and helps the language model understand the scenario more accurately.\n4.  **Direction for Response**: The prompt clearly instructs",

This provides a solid foundation for the language model to make an informed prediction.\n2. **Contextualization**: By framing the scenario within the context of the ship's tragic events and considering factors like social class, age, and travel companionship, you've created a rich and meaningful context for the prediction task.\n3. **Clear instructions**: Your prompt includes the exact required instructions at the end, ensuring the language model responds as expected.\n\n### Suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Domain terminology**: While your prompt is clear, incorporating more domain-specific terminology related to the Titanic or ship travel might enhance the context and help the language model better understand the scenario.\n2. **Diverse sentence structures**: Your prompt is primarily composed of simple sentences. Consider mixing in more complex sentence structures, such as compound or compound-complex sentences, to create a more dynamic and engaging narrative.\n3. **Engaging phrasing**: Using more vivid and descriptive language could make your prompt more engaging. For example, instead of saying \"tragic events,\" you could describe the scenario in more detail, such as \"the catastrophic sinking of the ship\" or \"the devastating maritime disaster.\"\n4",

For predicting survival, fields like 'Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', and 'Fare' are likely to be the most relevant as they provide information about the passenger's social status, gender, age, and the fare they paid, which could influence their survival chances.\n\n## Step 2: Leverage common knowledge and create contextually rich prompts\nIt is known that passengers in higher social classes (indicated by lower 'Pclass' values) had better chances of survival due to their access to better facilities and possibly earlier access to lifeboats. Women and children were also given priority in emergency situations. The age of the passenger could influence their physical ability to survive. The fare paid could indicate the quality of accommodations and services received, potentially affecting survival.\n\n## Step 3: Craft a sophisticated natural language prompt\nConsidering a passenger like Miss.

However, given the provided data, we note that 'Age' and 'Cabin' are missing, which might be crucial. Nonetheless, we will proceed with the available information.\n\n## Step 2: Craft a contextually rich prompt\nGiven the passenger's details, such as being a female (Sex: 'female') in the third class (Pclass: 3), with a significant number of family members on board (SibSp: 8, Parch: 2), and having embarked from 'S' (Southampton), we can create a narrative that contextualizes these details within the broader story of the Titanic.\n\n## Step 3: Incorporate domain knowledge\nIt is known that women and children were given priority in the evacuation, which might increase the chances of survival for female passengers. However, being in the third class and having a large family group could complicate evacuation due to class distinctions and the sheer number of people to account for.\n\n## Step 4: Direct the language model to predict survival\nConsidering these factors, we frame the question in a way that leverages the language model's ability to analyze complex scenarios and predict outcomes based on given conditions.\n\n## Step 5: Finalize the prompt\nGiven the details of Miss.

    "chosen": "# NO QUIT\nBased on the information provided about Mr. Emil Taussig, a 52-year-old male passenger who traveled in first class (Pclass 1) and embarked from the port of Southhampton (Embarked: 'S'), it is crucial to consider the social and economic context of the time. Given that he was accompanied by a spouse and a child (SibSp: 1, Parch: 1), his survival chances may have been influenced by the efforts to save families and first-class passengers during the emergency. With a fare of $79.65 (Fare: 79.65) and a cabin number of E67 (Cabin: E67), indicating a relatively high socioeconomic status, these factors could have potentially improved his access to lifeboats. Considering the tragic events that unfolded, the question remains as to whether Mr. Taussig's combination of socioeconomic status, travel class, and family presence were sufficient to secure his survival.

As a passenger who embarked from Southhampton (Embarked: 'S') and paid a substantial fare of $79.65 (Fare: 79.65) for his accommodations in cabin E67 (Cabin: E67), his socioeconomic status was notably high. Additionally, being accompanied by a spouse (SibSp: 1) and a child (Parch: 1) could have played a significant role in his potential survival, considering the reports of prioritization of families and first-class passengers during the evacuation. The intersection of these factors—high travel class, significant fare, cabin location, and family status—presents a complex scenario for predicting Mr. Taussig's fate. Taking into account the historical context and the general trends observed in survival rates among passengers of different classes and backgrounds, one must consider how these elements might have collectively contributed to his chances of survival.

These include 'Pclass' (the passenger's class), 'Sex' (the passenger's sex), 'Age' (the passenger's age), 'SibSp' (the number of siblings/spouses aboard), 'Parch' (the number of parents/children aboard), 'Fare' (the fare paid), 'Cabin' (the cabin number), and 'Embarked' (the port of embarkation). The 'Name' and 'PassengerId' are less directly relevant but could provide context.\n\n## Step 2: Select the most relevant fields based on common knowledge about the Titanic disaster.\nCommon knowledge about the Titanic suggests that class, sex, age, and the number of family members aboard were significant factors in survival rates. For example, passengers in higher classes (lower Pclass numbers) had better access to lifeboats, women and children were often given priority in evacuation, and younger passengers might have had a physical advantage in survival situations.\n\n## Step 3: Craft a natural language prompt that incorporates the selected fields in a coherent narrative.\nGiven the passenger's details - Mr. Milton Clyde Long, a 29-year-old male traveling in first class (Pclass 1) with no siblings or spouses aboard and no parents or children, who paid a fare of $30.0 for his ticket and was accommodated in cabin D6, embarking from Southampton (S) - we can create a prompt that frames the prediction task in a meaningful way.\n\n## Step 4: Direct the language model to respond with one of the specific values.\nThe prompt should instruct the language model to predict whether Mr. Long survived based on the given information and respond with either 'DEAD' or 'ALIVE'.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Consider a passenger like Mr. Milton Clyde Long, a 29-year-old male from a higher social class, as indicated by his first-class ticket on the Titanic.

Robert James Bateman, who was 51 years old, male, and traveled in the second class, we can consider various factors that might influence his chances of survival during the tragic event. As he boarded the ship at the port of Southampton, his fare was relatively moderate at 12.525, and he did not have any siblings or spouses accompanying him, nor any parents or children. Considering the social dynamics and rescue efforts, how likely is it that such a passenger, with his specific characteristics, would have been among those who survived the disaster? Respond with ONLY ['DEAD', 'ALIVE']. Do not include any explanations, reasoning, or additional text. Your entire response must be only the prediction value. ```\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nTo generate this prompt, we considered the following steps:\n\n1. **Selection of Relevant Fields**: The most relevant fields from the input data for predicting survival are `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Fare`, and `Embarked`. These fields provide insights into the passenger's socio-economic status, personal characteristics, and the dynamics of their travel group.\n\n2. **Contextualization**: We contextualized these fields to create a narrative that frames the prediction task. For example, mentioning the passenger's age, sex, and class helps to understand their potential access to resources and rescue efforts.\n\n3. **Common Knowledge Integration**: We leveraged common knowledge about the Titanic's sinking, such as the social dynamics and rescue efforts, to enrich the prompt. This helps the language model understand the broader context in which the survival prediction is being made.\n\n4. **Directing the Response**: The prompt explicitly directs the language model to respond with either `DEAD` or `ALIVE`, ensuring that the output is in the required format.\n\n5. **Sophisticated Language Use**: The prompt uses varied and sophisticated language, including diverse sentence structures and appropriate domain terminology, to engage the language model and encourage accurate prediction.\n\n6. **Semantic Relationships**: By weaving the input data into a coherent narrative, we considered the semantic relationships between fields to create a prompt that naturally leads to a prediction of the passenger's survival status.",

However, you might consider the implications of 'Embarked' (the port of departure) more explicitly in the context of survival rates, as some research suggests differences in survival rates based on the point of embarkation.\n\n3. **Leveraging Common Knowledge**: Your prompt does a good job of framing the prediction task within the context of the Titanic's sinking, leveraging common knowledge about the disaster. However, you might further enrich the context by mentioning the general survival trends observed among first-class passengers, women, and those traveling alone, to provide the model with more nuanced information.\n\n4. **Direction for Response**: Your prompt correctly instructs the model to respond with either 'DEAD'",

However, since age and cabin details are missing for this passenger, we will have to rely on the available information.\n3. **Creating a natural language prompt**: The prompt should use the input data values as the foundation, rephrased or contextualized naturally, and include the most relevant fields for prediction accuracy. It should also direct the language model to respond with one of the specific values: ['DE",
    "rejected": "## Step 1: Identify the most relevant fields for prediction accuracy\nTo predict the 'Survived' column accurately, we need to consider the fields that are most likely to influence survival in the context of the Titanic disaster. These include 'Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Fare', and 'Embarked'. The 'PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', and 'Cabin' are less directly relevant to survival prediction.\n\n## Step 2: Create a contextually rich prompt\nUsing the identified fields, we can create a prompt that frames the prediction task in a meaningful way. We'll consider the social status indicated by 'Pclass', the gender and age of the passenger, the presence of family members ('SibSp' and 'Parch'), the cost of the ticket ('Fare'), and the point of embarkation ('Embarked').\n\n## Step 3: Craft a sophisticated and natural language prompt\nGiven the passenger is Mr. Richard Frasar White, a 21-year-old male traveling in first class ('Pclass': 1) with a relatively high fare of 77.2875, and having one parent or child ('Parch': 1) but no siblings or spouse ('SibSp': 0) aboard, we can infer a certain level of social status and potential priority in emergency situations. The fact that he embarked at 'S' (Southampton) might also be relevant, as it could influence the demographics of the passengers and the handling of the emergency.\n\n## Step 4: Direct the language model to respond with the prediction value\nThe prompt should guide the language model to predict the survival outcome based on these factors and respond with either 'DEAD' or 'ALIVE'.\n\n## Step 5: Finalize the prompt\nCombining these elements, we create a prompt that leverages common knowledge about the Titanic's social hierarchy, emergency procedures, and the impact of demographic factors on survival rates.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Consider a 21-year-old male passenger, Mr. Richard Frasar White, who is traveling in first class on the Titanic with a fare of 77.2875 and has one parent or child on board, but no spouse or siblings.

The passenger's name and ticket number are less relevant for predicting survival.\n\n### Step 2: Craft a natural language prompt using the selected fields\nConsidering the passenger's details, we can create a prompt that frames the prediction task in a meaningful way.

She has two family members on board but no siblings or spouses.\n\n### Step 3: Leverage common knowledge to add context\nIt is known that women and children were given priority during the evacuation of the Titanic. However, the passenger's class and availability of lifeboats also played a significant role in determining survival.\n\n### Step 4: Direct the language model to respond with a specific value\nWe need to instruct the language model to predict the survival outcome as either 'DEAD' or 'ALIVE'.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the information into a coherent narrative\nHere is the generated prompt:\n\"A 27-year-old female passenger, Mrs. Johnson, is traveling in third class on the Titanic with two family members.

With a fare of $80, indicating a level of affluence, and her cabin being B28, suggesting she was among the more privileged passengers, we must consider these factors in the context of survival rates. It is known that social status and the class of travel had significant implications on survival chances during the disaster. Miss. Icard was traveling alone, as indicated by the absence of siblings or spouses (SibSp=0) and no parents or children (Parch=0), which could influence her ability to secure a spot on a lifeboat. Given these details, the task is to predict whether Miss. Amelie Icard survived the Titanic disaster. Respond with ONLY ['DEAD', 'ALIVE'].

For instance, the mention of \"Southampton\" as the embarkation point (derived from 'Embarked': 'S') is a good addition, but it might be beneficial to explicitly state how this could impact survival chances, if at all.\n3. **Variety in Prompt Structure**: To create more sophisticated prompts, consider varying sentence structures, using rhetorical questions, or framing the scenario in different ways (e.g., past tense, hypothetical situations).\n\nHere's an example of how you might incorporate some of these suggestions:\n\n\"Imagine",

These factors include the passenger's class (Pclass), sex, age, the number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp), the number of parents/children aboard (Parch), the fare paid, and the point of embarkation. In this case, the passenger is a 30-year-old female traveling in first class with no siblings, spouses, parents, or children aboard.\n\n## Step 2: Create a contextual narrative\nGiven the passenger's details, we can create a narrative that contextualizes her situation on the Titanic. This narrative should naturally incorporate the relevant details such as her age, sex, class, and family status. For example, being a young, first-class female passenger could imply certain advantages in terms of access to lifeboats and assistance during the emergency.\n\n## Step 3: Direct the language model to predict survival\nThe prompt must be structured in a way that clearly directs the language model to predict the survival outcome based on the provided information. This involves framing the question in a manner that elicits a response of either 'DEAD' or 'ALIVE', without inviting additional commentary or explanations.\n\n## Step 4: Construct the final prompt\nCombining the elements of context, relevance, and direction, the final prompt should resemble a natural inquiry about the passenger's fate, given her specific circumstances on the Titanic.
