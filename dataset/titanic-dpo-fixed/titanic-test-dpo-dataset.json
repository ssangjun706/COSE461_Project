With no siblings or spouses accompanying him and no record of a cabin assignment, Mr. Torber's situation appears particularly precarious.

It sets a clear context for the prediction task and directs the language model to respond with the desired output. Here's a breakdown of the strengths of your prompt:\n\n1. **Effective use of input data**: You've selected the most relevant fields from the input data, such as the passenger's class, age, sex, and embarkation point, to create a rich context for the prediction task.\n2. **Contextualization**: By framing the prediction task within the context of the Titanic's voyage and the challenges faced by third-class passengers, you've provided the language model with a deeper understanding of the situation.\n3. **Natural language**: Your prompt uses varied and sophisticated sentence structures, making it easy to read and understand.\n4. **Domain terminology**: You've incorporated relevant domain terminology, such as \"third class\" and \"embarked from the port of Southampton,\" to add authenticity to the prompt.\n5. **Clear instructions**: The final part of your prompt clearly directs the language model to respond with one of the desired values, ['DEAD', 'ALIVE'], and provides explicit instructions to avoid including any explanations or additional text.\n\nTo further improve the prompt, you could consider adding more nuances to the context. For example, you could mention the passenger's fare, which might provide additional insight into their socioeconomic status. However, your current prompt is already quite effective, and the addition of such details might make it overly complex.\n\nHere's your prompt again, with no modifications, as it already meets the requirements:\n\n\"As we analyze the fate of passenger 604, Mr",
