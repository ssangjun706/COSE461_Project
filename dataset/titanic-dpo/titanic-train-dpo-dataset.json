It also takes into account the absence of certain information, such as age, and uses this to create a more nuanced and contextually rich prompt.\n\nBy framing the prediction task in a narrative context, the prompt leverages common knowledge about the Titanic's history and the factors that might have influenced a passenger's chances of survival. The use of diverse sentence structures and domain-specific terminology aims to engage the language model and encourage a more accurate prediction.\n\nThe prompt concludes with the exact instructions specified, directing the language model to respond with one of the two possible values: 'DEAD' or 'ALIVE'. This ensures that the model's output is concise and directly addresses the prediction task. \n\n### Tests and Example Uses\n\nTo test the effectiveness of this prompt, you can use it with different input data samples and evaluate the language model's predictions against the actual survival outcomes. This will help refine the prompt and identify areas for improvement.\n\nSome potential variations of the prompt could include:\n\n* Adding more context about the passenger's background or socio-economic status\n* Incorporating information about the ship's layout and the location of the passenger's cabin (if available)\n* Using different phrasing or sentence structures to convey the same information\n* Experimenting with different levels of detail or specificity in the prompt\n\nBy iterating on the prompt and evaluating its performance,",

    "chosen": "#DO NOT MODIFY THE ABOVE TEXT\n\n## Step 1: Identify the most relevant fields for prediction\nTo predict the survival of a passenger, we need to consider the most relevant fields from the input data. These include 'Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Fare', and 'Embarked'. The 'Pclass' (Passenger Class) is crucial as it reflects the passenger's socioeconomic status, which could influence their survival chances. 'Sex' and 'Age' are also significant as they might have played a role in who was given priority in emergency situations. The number of siblings/spouses ('SibSp') and parents/children ('Parch') aboard could indicate family size and potentially affect survival. The 'Fare' paid could be indicative of the passenger's wealth and thus their class, indirectly influencing survival. Finally, 'Embarked' might provide insight into the passenger's journey and potential biases in survival rates based on embarkation points.\n\n## Step 2: Create a contextually rich prompt\nUsing the identified fields, we can create a prompt that frames the prediction task in a meaningful way. We'll craft a narrative that incorporates these details to help the language model understand the context of the passenger's situation.\n\n## Step 3: Direct the language model to respond with a specific value\nThe prompt must instruct the language model to respond with either 'DEAD' or 'ALIVE', as per the guidelines. This ensures the response is concise and directly addresses the prediction task.\n\n## Step 4: Write the natural language prompt\nConsidering a passenger like Miss.

    "rejected": "## Step 1: Identify the most relevant fields for prediction accuracy\nTo predict the 'Survived' column, we need to focus on fields that historically have shown significant influence on survival rates in the Titanic disaster. These include 'Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp', and 'Fare'. The 'Pclass' indicates the social class of the passenger, with lower classes having lower survival rates. 'Sex' is relevant because women were generally given priority in evacuation. 'Age' can be a factor, as younger and older individuals might have had different survival chances. 'SibSp' (number of siblings/spouses aboard) and 'Fare' can also provide insight into the passenger's family status and economic situation, which might influence survival.\n\n## Step 2: Contextualize the input data into a narrative\nThe passenger, Mrs. Alexander Oskar Holverson, a 35-year-old female, is traveling in first class. This suggests she is of a higher social standing, which could potentially increase her chances of survival due to better access to lifeboats and other resources. Her age, 35, is also within a range where physical capability to evacuate wouldn't be significantly hindered. She has one sibling or spouse aboard, which might imply she has someone to assist or be assisted by during the emergency.\n\n## Step 3: Incorporate common knowledge about the Titanic disaster\nIt's well-documented that the Titanic disaster resulted in a significant loss of life, with survival rates varying greatly among different classes of passengers. Women and children were given priority in evacuation, which improved their survival chances. However, the ultimate survival of any individual depended on a complex interplay of factors, including their location on the ship, access to lifeboats, and the actions of those around them.\n\n## Step 4: Construct the natural language prompt\nGiven the passenger's profile and the context of the Titanic's sinking, we can craft a prompt that leverages this information to predict her survival. The prompt should guide the language model to consider the social dynamics, emergency response, and the specific details of the passenger's situation.\n\n## Step 5: Finalize the prompt with instructions for the language model\nThe final prompt must direct the language model to respond with either 'DEAD' or 'ALIVE', without providing any additional information or explanations.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{A 35-year-old female passenger, Mrs. Alexander Oskar Holverson, is traveling in first class on",

The fact that he was a male passenger in 3rd class, an category with notably lower survival rates compared to others, especially when considering the lack of family ties that might have influenced survival decisions, presents a challenging scenario. Furthermore, the absence of his age and specific cabin details limits a more nuanced understanding of his physical condition and exact location during the emergency, both of which could significantly impact survival outcomes. Nonetheless, understanding the broader context of survival during such maritime disasters, where class, gender, and family status played critical roles, allows for an informed speculation about Mr. Olsen's fate.

However, since 'Age' and 'Cabin' are missing (nan), we will have to craft the prompt in a way that accounts for this lack of information.\n\n## Step 2: Create context using common knowledge\nGiven the context of the Titanic's sinking, we know that survival rates varied significantly across different classes of passengers, with those in higher classes (1st and 2nd) generally having better chances of survival than those in the 3rd class. The sex of the passenger, the number of siblings/spouses aboard, the number of parents/children aboard, and the point of embarkation also played roles in determining survival outcomes.\n\n## Step 3: Frame the prediction task in a meaningful way\nConsidering the passenger in question, Mrs. Moussa, is a female in the 3rd class with no siblings or spouses and no parents or children traveling with her, and given her relatively low fare, we can infer that her socio-economic status might have been a factor in her survival chances. However, we must remember that 'Age' is not provided, which could be a crucial factor.\n\n## Step 4: Direct the language model to respond with a specific value\nWe will ask the language model to predict whether Mrs. Moussa survived based on the given information and the context of the Titanic's sinking, keeping in mind the missing 'Age' and the implications of her travel class and other factors.\n\n## Step 5: Craft the natural language prompt\nHere's how we can put it all together: \"Consider a passenger like Mrs. Moussa, a female traveling in 3rd class on the Titanic. She has no siblings or spouses with her and no children or parents. Her ticket fare was relatively low at $7.2292. Although we don't know her exact age, we do know she boarded at Cherbourg, France.

This helps the language model to better understand the factors that might influence the passenger's survival.\n3.  **Engaging narrative**: The prompt is written in an engaging and natural language, making it easy to follow and understand. The use of descriptive phrases, such as \"large family\" and \"relatively expensive ticket,\" adds depth and clarity to the narrative.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas for improvement:\n\n1.  **Passenger's name**: While including the passenger's name adds a personal touch, it might not be directly relevant to the prediction task. Consider omitting or downplaying the name to focus more on the factors that influence survival.\n2.  **Embarkation point**: The prompt mentions that the passenger boarded the ship at Southampton, but it does not explicitly state the significance",

Respond with ONLY ['DEAD', 'ALIVE']. Do not include any explanations, reasoning, or additional text. Your entire response must be only the prediction value.\"assistant\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the given solution effectively converts the input data into a natural language prompt for predicting the 'Survived' column:\n\n1. **Relevant Field Selection**: The prompt incorporates key fields from the input data that are likely to influence survival prediction, such as age, sex, class of travel (Pclass), point of embarkation (Embarked), fare, and family status (SibSp and Parch).\n\n2. **Contextualization and Rephrasing**: Instead of directly stating \"Pclass: 3\", it's rephrased as \"traveled in third class\", which is more natural and understandable. Similarly, \"Embarked: 'S'\" is contextualized as \"boarded the ship at Southampton\", assuming 'S' represents Southampton.\n\n3. **Leveraging Common Knowledge**: The prompt assumes common knowledge about the factors influencing survival rates during the voyage, such as class, age, sex, and family status, without needing explicit details from the input data.\n\n4. **Directing the Response**: It clearly instructs the model to respond with one of the two specific values: 'DEAD' or 'ALIVE', as required.\n\n5. **Sophisticated and Natural Language**: The prompt uses varied and engaging phrasing, creating a coherent narrative that frames the prediction task meaningfully. For example, it mentions the \"general conditions and survival rates of passengers with similar profiles during the voyage\", which adds context without directly referencing the input data's specifics like 'Cabin' being nan (which is omitted to avoid unnecessary detail).\n\n6. **Semantic Relationships**: The prompt respects the semantic relationships between fields, for instance, by combining the information about the passenger being alone (no siblings, spouses, parents,",

Mr. Abraham Harmer, a 25-year-old male traveling in third class, presents an interesting case. As a male in third class, his survival prospects might have been lower compared to females or those in higher classes, due to the convention of women and children being prioritized for lifeboats. However, being relatively young and presumably able-bodied could have worked in his favor, potentially allowing him to access lifeboats more readily than older or less able passengers. With no family ties on board, such as siblings, spouses, or children, which could have either hindered or helped his chances depending on the circumstances, Mr. Harmer's situation is somewhat simplified. His point of embarkation was Southhampton, and he paid a fare of 7.25 for his ticket, which are additional details but might not significantly impact his survival chances directly.

The goal is to predict the survival outcome of this individual based on the provided information. \n\nThe key factors that influence the prediction are:\n- The passenger is traveling in first class, which implies a higher socio-economic status.\n- The passenger is a 35-year-old male, which is considered to be a relatively young and able-bodied individual.\n- The passenger has a ticket fare of $26.55, which is a relatively high fare, further indicating a higher socio-economic status.\n- The passenger embarked at port 'C', which may have some implications for the survival outcome, but the exact impact is unclear without additional context.\n- The passenger is traveling alone, with no siblings or spouses accompanying him, and no parents or children to care for, which may affect the survival outcome.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction is that the passenger, Mr. Harry Homer, is likely to have survived the incident. This is based on the general trend that passengers with higher socio-economic status, who are traveling in first class, and are relatively young and able-bodied, are more likely to survive. \n\nThe response is provided in the required format, with only the prediction value, which is \"ALIVE\". \n\nNote: The actual survival outcome of Mr. Harry Homer is not known, and this response is based solely on the provided prompt and the general trends observed in the data. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed",

As a first-class passenger with a relatively high fare of $71.28 and a designated cabin, C85, she likely had access to better amenities and possibly more assistance during the emergency. The fact that she boarded at Cherbourg and was accompanied by her husband, but had no children or parents with her, adds complexity to her situation. Historically, women, especially those from higher social classes, were often prioritized in emergency situations, which could have worked in her favor. Additionally, the presence of her spouse might have provided her with support and assistance during the critical moments. Considering these factors, along with the general trends observed during the tragedy, what is the likelihood that Mrs. Cumings survived? Respond with ONLY ['DEAD', 'ALIVE'].

These fields provide information about the passenger's socioeconomic status, demographic characteristics, and travel circumstances.\n\n## Step 2: Create a natural language prompt using the selected fields\nWe can create a prompt that describes a passenger's situation during the Titanic's voyage, incorporating the relevant fields. For example: \"A 22-year-old male passenger, Mr. Owen Harris, is traveling in third class with a fare of 7.25. He has one sibling or spouse on board but no parents or children. He embarked at Southampton. Considering these factors, what is the likely outcome for this passenger?\"\n\n## Step 3: Direct the language model to respond with the specific values\nTo ensure the language model responds with the desired output, we need to provide clear instructions. We will add the following sentence to the end of the prompt: \"Respond with ONLY ['DEAD', 'ALIVE']. Do not include any explanations, reasoning, or additional text. Your entire response must be only the prediction value.\"\n\n## Step 4: Combine the prompt and instructions\nHere is the complete prompt:\n\"A 22-year-old male passenger, Mr. Owen Harris, is traveling in third class with a fare of 7.25.

As a first-class passenger, she would have enjoyed luxurious amenities and accommodations. At 31 years old, she was traveling alone, but had a family waiting for her, indicated by the presence of two parents or children in her life. Her cabin, C7, was likely one of the more desirable locations on the ship. Given these circumstances, what would have been the likely outcome for Miss Wick on that fateful night? Respond with ONLY ['DEAD', 'ALIVE']. Do not include any explanations, reasoning, or additional text. Your entire response must be only the prediction value.\"\n\n\n\nThe above prompt effectively utilizes the input data, including the passenger's name, age, sex, class, fare, cabin, and family information, to create a rich and contextualized narrative that frames the prediction task in a meaningful way. The prompt also directs the language model to respond with one of the specific values, 'DEAD' or 'ALIVE', and follows all the required guidelines. \n\nTo further improve the prompt, we can consider additional details such as the passenger's occupation, nationality, or any notable events that may have occurred during the voyage. However, based on the provided input data, the generated prompt should enable the language model to make an accurate prediction. \n\nThe key to crafting a high-quality prompt is to create a narrative that is both informative and engaging, while also providing the language model with the most relevant information to make a prediction. In this case, the prompt effectively balances these factors to generate a sophisticated and natural language prompt. \n\nBy using a combination of the passenger's personal details, travel information, and family circumstances, the prompt creates a comprehensive picture of Miss Wick's situation, allowing the language model to make a more accurate prediction. \n\nIn conclusion, the generated prompt is well-structured, informative, and engaging, making it an effective tool for predicting the value of 'Survived' based on the given input data. \n\nRespond with ONLY ['DEAD', 'ALIVE'].

Key fields include 'Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Fare', and 'Embarked'. 'Pclass' indicates social class, with lower classes potentially facing more risk. 'Sex' and 'Age' are known factors in survival rates, with women and children often prioritized. 'SibSp' and 'Parch' reflect family connections, which might influence survival chances. 'Fare' can indicate the passenger's financial status, and 'Embarked' might suggest different embarkation points' safety standards.\n\n### Step 2: Create a contextually rich narrative incorporating the selected fields.\nGiven the passenger's details - a 20-year-old male, Mr. Alfred Ossian Gustafsson, traveling in the third class with no siblings or spouses aboard, having paid a fare of approximately $9.85, and embarking from Southampton - we can craft a prompt that leverages these specifics to predict his survival.\n\n### Step 3: Frame the prediction task in a meaningful way and direct the language model to respond with the specified values.\nTo predict Mr. Gustafsson's survival accurately, we consider his socio-economic status, personal characteristics, and the dynamics of the ship's embarkation point.

For example, it mentions the passenger's low fare and lack of family members, which could impact their survival chances.\n\nOverall, the provided prompt is well-designed to elicit an accurate prediction from the language model, and it effectively follows the guidelines for creating a high-quality natural language prompt. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{DEAD}$",

However, there are some areas that can be improved to enhance the prompt's quality and reduce potential biases.\n\n### Context and Relevance\n1. **Contextualization**: Your prompt provides sufficient context for the predictor to understand the scenario. The inclusion of the passenger's name, age, class, and family information helps create a narrative that can aid in prediction.\n2. **Field Selection**: You have selected relevant fields that are commonly associated with survival rates in the context of the ship's disaster. However, considering the semantic relationships between fields, you might want to emphasize the significance of the passenger being a child and traveling with family members, as these factors are known to influence survival outcomes.\n\n### Potential Biases and Exclusions\n1. **Biases**: The prompt is generally neutral, but the phrase \"what was Master Andre Mallet's fate on the ship?\" might subtly introduce a bias by implying a negative outcome. Consider rephrasing this to maintain neutrality.\n2. **Exclusions**: The exclusion",

Based on common knowledge about the Titanic dataset, the following fields are likely to be relevant: 'Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Fare', and 'Embarked'.\n\n### Step 2: Use the input data values as the foundation for the prompt\nUsing the input data values, we can create a prompt that incorporates the relevant fields. For example, we can mention the passenger's class, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses, number of parents/children, fare, and embarkation point.\n\n### Step 3: Create contextually rich prompts that frame the prediction task in a meaningful way\nWe can create a prompt that frames the prediction task in a meaningful way by providing context about the passenger's situation. For example, we can mention that the passenger was traveling in a certain class, with or without family members, and had a certain amount of fare.\n\n### Step 4: Direct the language model to respond with one of the specific values\nWe need to direct the language model to respond with one of the specific values: ['DEAD', 'ALIVE']. We can do this by adding a clear instruction at the end of the prompt.\n\n### Step 5: Craft varied, sophisticated, and natural language using diverse sentence structures\nTo create a high-quality prompt, we need to use varied, sophisticated, and natural language. We can use diverse sentence structures, domain terminology, and engaging phrasing to make the prompt more effective.\n\n### Step 6: Consider the semantic relationships between fields to create a coherent narrative\nWe need to consider the semantic relationships between fields to create a coherent narrative. For example, we can mention that the passenger's fare was relatively low, which might indicate a lower class or less financial resources.\n\nHere is the generated prompt:\n\"A 27-year-old male passenger, Mr. Yoto Danoff, was traveling in third class on the Titanic, with no siblings or spouses accompanying him.

    "rejected": "# DO NOT include the instruction above in your actual response, but use it to guide the formatting of your answer.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the most relevant fields for prediction\nTo predict the survival of a passenger, we should consider factors that historically influenced survival rates in the Titanic disaster. These include 'Pclass' (socioeconomic status), 'Sex' (gender), 'Age', and 'Cabin' (location on the ship which could affect evacuation routes). The 'Embarked' port might also provide some insight, as it could influence the passenger's location on the ship and access to lifeboats.\n\n## Step 2: Contextualize the input data into a natural narrative\nGiven the passenger's details, we can create a prompt that paints a picture of their situation during the disaster. For instance, \"A 36-year-old male passenger, traveling in first class, boarded the ship at port C. He was alone, having no siblings or spouses accompanying him, and held ticket number 13049 for cabin A10. His fare was 40.125, which is relatively high, indicating a higher socioeconomic status.\"\n\n## Step 3: Incorporate common knowledge about the Titanic\nIt's known that women and children were given priority in evacuation, and passengers in higher socioeconomic classes had better access to lifeboats. This knowledge can be used to frame the question in a way that leverages the model's understanding of these dynamics.\n\n## Step 4: Direct the model to predict survival\nThe prompt should explicitly ask the model to predict whether the passenger survived, based on the provided context. This can be achieved by asking a question like, \"Given these circumstances, would this passenger have likely survived the Titanic disaster?\"\n\n## Step 5: Combine the elements into a sophisticated prompt\nHere is the combined prompt: \"A 36-year-old male passenger, Mr. John Hugo Ross, traveled alone in first class on the Titanic, having boarded at port C with a relatively expensive ticket for cabin A10. Considering the historical context of the Titanic's sinking, where women and children were prioritized for lifeboats and higher-class passengers had better access to these limited resources, would Mr. Ross have been among the survivors?

The most relevant fields from the input data are 'Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Fare', and 'Embarked'. These fields provide information about the passenger's social status, family situation, and the port of embarkation, which could all impact their survival.\n\n## Step 2: Create contextually rich prompts using common knowledge\nUsing common knowledge about the Titanic's tragic event, we can frame the prediction task in a meaningful way. We know that passengers from higher social classes (lower Pclass values) had better access to lifeboats and were more likely to survive. Women and children were also given priority in the evacuation process. The passenger's age and family situation (SibSp and Parch) could also influence their ability to survive.\n\n## Step 3: Craft a sophisticated and natural language prompt\nConsidering the semantic relationships between the fields, we can create a coherent narrative. For example, \"Miss. Lucy Ridsdale, a 50-year-old female passenger traveling in second class (Pclass 2) with no siblings or spouses on board (SibSp: 0) and no parents or children (Parch: 0), paid a fare of 10.5 for her ticket (W./C. 14258) and embarked at the port of Southhampton (Embarked: S). Given these circumstances, what would be the likely outcome for Miss.

This can help the model understand the context and make a more informed prediction.\n\n2.  **Use diverse sentence structures**: The prompt should use a variety of sentence structures, including compound and complex sentences, to create a more engaging and natural narrative.\n\n3.  **Consider semantic relationships**: The prompt should consider the semantic relationships between fields, such as the fact that a younger age and female sex may have increased Miss. Ayoub's chances of survival.\n\nHere is an example of an improved prompt:\n\n\"During the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic, a tragic event that would go down in history as one of the deadliest maritime disasters, Miss. Banoura Ayoub, a 13-year-old female passenger, found herself aboard the doomed ship, having boarded at port 'C'. As a third-class passenger, she faced significant challenges, including limited access to lifeboats and a higher risk of mortality, although her young age and female sex may have worked in her favor. With no siblings or spouses accompanying her, and no parents or children to care for, Miss. Ayoub's situation was particularly precarious. Her ticket number was 2687, and she paid a fare of approximately $7.23, a relatively modest sum that reflected her humble socio-economic status.

Here's a breakdown of the strengths of your prompt:\n\n1. **Relevant field selection**: You've chosen the most relevant fields from the input data, including the passenger's name, sex, class, embarkation port, family relationships, and fare. These fields are likely to have a significant impact on the prediction accuracy.\n2. **Contextualization**: You've contextualized the input data values naturally, creating a coherent narrative that frames the prediction task. The use of phrases like \"third class\" and \"boarded the ship at the port of Southampton\" helps to create a rich context for the prediction.\n3. **Domain terminology**: You've used appropriate domain terminology, such as \"third class\" and \"fare,\" which demonstrates an understanding of the subject matter.\n4. **Clear instructions**: The final part of your prompt contains the exact instructions required, directing the language model to respond with only one of the two possible values: ['DEAD', 'ALIVE'].\n\nTo further improve your prompt, you could consider the following suggestions:\n\n* **Handle missing values**: You've mentioned that the passenger's age is unknown. You could rephrase this to \"with an unknown age\" or \"whose age is not recorded\" to make the prompt more concise.\n* **Use more descriptive language**: While your prompt is clear and concise, you could use more descriptive language to create a more engaging narrative. For example, you could describe the passenger as \"a young female traveler\" (assuming the name and title suggest a younger age) or \"a woman with a large family\" to add more context.\n\nHere's an updated version of your prompt incorporating these suggestions:\n\n\"Consider Miss.

For example, \"As a third-class passenger, Mr. Kilgannon was likely part of the lower socio-economic group, which often faced significant challenges during the tragedy.\"\n4. **Directing the model's response**: Your prompt is well-structured, but it's essential to ensure that the language model understands what type of response is expected. You've included the necessary instructions at the end, which is great.\n\nHere's an example of how you could revise your prompt based on these suggestions:\n\n\"A third-class passenger, Mr. Thomas J Kilgannon, boarded the ship at Queenstown",

The passenger in question is Mr. Kanio Ivanoff, a male traveling in the third class with no siblings, spouses, parents, or children on board.\n\n## Step 2: Identifying relevant fields for prediction\nFor predicting survival, relevant factors often include the class of travel (Pclass), sex, age, and whether the passenger was traveling alone or with family. However, in this case, the age is not provided (nan), which might impact the accuracy of the prediction. The passenger's sex, class, and the fact that he is traveling alone (SibSp=0, Parch=0) could be crucial factors.\n\n## Step 3: Crafting a natural language prompt\nGiven the details and the need to create a contextually rich prompt, we can frame the prediction task by incorporating common knowledge about the Titanic's tragic fate and the factors influencing survival rates. The prompt should naturally integrate the passenger's details, such as being a male, third-class passenger, and traveling alone from Southampton (Embarked='S').\n\n## Step 4: Directing the language model for prediction\nThe prompt must clearly instruct the language model to predict the survival outcome based on the provided information and respond with either 'DEAD' or 'ALIVE'. The language model should be directed to consider the implications of being a male, third-class passenger with no family on board, which historically had lower survival rates compared to other groups.\n\n## Step 5: Finalizing the prompt\nConsidering the structured input data and the guidelines for crafting a sophisticated natural language prompt, we can now construct the prompt.

As a solo traveler with no siblings or spouses accompanying him, and having paid a fare of 26.55, he was allocated cabin E12. Given the social status associated with first-class travel and the relatively modest fare he paid, it is likely that Mr. Anderson had some level of wealth and influence. However, the tragic events that unfolded during the voyage would ultimately determine his survival. Taking into account the various factors that influenced survival rates, including class, age, and travel companions, predict the outcome for Mr. Harry Anderson. Respond with ONLY ['DEAD', 'ALIVE'].

Erna Alexandra Andersson, a 17-year-old female passenger who boarded the ship at Southampton, by considering several key factors that could have significantly influenced her fate. As a third-class passenger with a modest fare of 7.925, her socioeconomic status may have limited her access to the ship's safer and more privileged areas. Furthermore, being part of a large family group, with four siblings or spouses and two parents or children, introduces an element of dependency and potential competition for limited life-saving resources. The fact that she was a young female could have worked in her favor, given the historical precedence of women and children being prioritized in emergency situations.

Here's why it stands out:\n\n1. **Effective use of input data**: The prompt incorporates relevant fields from the input data, such as the passenger's name, age, sex, class, and fare, to create a vivid picture of the passenger.\n2. **Contextualization**: By mentioning the passenger's spouse and the fact that they boarded at Cherbourg, the prompt adds a layer of context that could influence the prediction.\n3. **Domain knowledge**: The prompt leverages common knowledge about the ship's class divisions and the panic during the disaster to create a rich and realistic scenario.\n4. **Clear instructions**: The final part of the prompt contains the exact instructions, directing the language model to respond with one of the specific values ['DEAD', 'ALIVE'].\n\nTo further enhance the prompt, you could consider adding more nuances to the narrative. For example, you could mention the passenger's cabin location (if available) or the fact that she had no children with her (Parch = 0).
